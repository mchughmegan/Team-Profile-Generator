Once the user indicates that there are no more employees to add, the terminal will explain that there is a new html document.

The user can now locate their index.html for their Team Profile in the dist folder. When the user right clicks on the newly generated index.html, they will be able to preview it in their web browser by choosing Open in Default Browser.

![Open in Browser](https://github.com/mchughmegan/Team-Profile-Generator/blob/main/assets/View%20in%20default%20browser.png)

When the user sees the newly generated index.html in the web browser, they will see a page with My Team at the top, and cards with team members and their applicable information in the main section.
